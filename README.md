~~monsterwm~~ ~~mwm~~ acktwm
=====================

acktwm is the Ack Ack Tiling WM (from Mars Attacks) as featured on the
console of the Nars ship. acktwm is a fork of monsterwm. acktwm *is not* a
dynamic tiling window manager. Short of unexpectedly ruining any arrangement of
windows through dynamic tiling that makes a wm rigid and obtrusive. The wm does
not get in the way of workflows and so it aims to be more flexible to use than
any dynamic tiling window manager. It features an open-ended design with
minimal overhead on system resources. There is no Windows-esque panel natively
builtin. Status reports are sent through the dbus protocol and presented as OSD
notifications.

Supported on FreeBSD, Linux (musl libc and glibc distros).

Feature requests and bug reports are welcome.

Ack Ack!


~~â†’ tiny but monstrous!~~
---------------------

~~**monsterwm** is a minimal, lightweight, tiny but monstrous dynamic tiling
window manager.  It will try to stay as small as possible. Currently under 700
lines with the config file included.  It provides a set of different layout
modes (see below), including floating mode support.  Each virtual desktop has
its own properties, unaffected by other desktops' or monitors' settings.  For
[screenshots][scrot] and ramblings/updates check the [topic on ArchLinux
forums][monsterwm].

Modes
-----

Monsterwm allows opening the new window as master or
opening the window at the bottom of the stack (attach\_aside)

---

*Common tiling mode:*

    --------------
    |        | W |
    |        |___|
    | Master |   |
    |        |___|
    |        |   |
    --------------

---

*Bottom Stack (bstack) tiling mode:*

    -------------
    |           |
    |  Master   |
    |-----------|
    | W |   |   |
    -------------

---

 *Grid tiling mode:*

    -------------
    |   |   |   |
    |---|---|---|
    |   |   |   |
    |---|---|---|
    |   |   |   |
    -------------

one can have as many windows he wants.
`GRID` layout automatically manages the rows and columns.

---

 *Monocle mode* (aka fullscreen)

    -------------
    |           |
    | no        |
    | borders!  |
    |           |
    -------------

`MONOCLE` layout presents one window at a time in fullscreen mode.
Windows have no borders on this layout to save space.
See the `monocleborders` branch to give those windows borders.

---

 *floating mode*

    -------------
    |  |        |
    |--'  .---. |
    |     |   | |
    |     |   | |
    ------`---'--

 In floating mode one can freely move and resize windows in the screen space.
 Changing desktops, adding or removing floating windows, does not affect the
 floating status of the windows. Windows will revert to their tiling mode
 position once the user selects a tiling mode.  To enter the floating mode,
 either change the layout to `FLOAT`, or enabled it by moving or resizing a
 window with the mouse, the window is then marked as being in floating mode.

---

All shortcuts are accessible via the keyboard and the mouse, and defined in
`config.h` file.

All desktops store their settings independently.

 * The window W at the top of the stack can be resized on a per desktop basis.
 * Changing a tiling mode or window size on one desktop doesn't affect the
 * other desktops.  toggling the panel in one desktop does not affect the state
 * of the panel in other desktops.


Installation
------------

You need Xlib, then,
copy `config.def.h` as `config.h`
and edit to suit your needs.
Build and install.
